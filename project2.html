            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The application is built on a microservices architecture to ensure
                modularity and scalability. Each microservice handles a specific
                functionality, such as fetching prices, managing notifications, or
                processing user preferences. This architecture allows independent scaling
                and enhances the app's fault tolerance.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frontend:</strong> React Native for a responsive and
                    cross-platform user interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Backend:</strong> Python Flask for API management and data
                    processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL for storing product details, user
                    preferences, and transaction logs.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
            <p>
                The app integrates with retailer APIs to fetch product details, prices, and
                availability. A centralized API gateway manages all external communications,
                ensuring data consistency and reliability. Advanced caching mechanisms are
                employed to reduce API call latency and improve performance under high user
                traffic.
            </p>
            <h4>Technical Highlights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>API Gateway:</strong> Centralized routing of API requests to
                    appropriate microservices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Notification Engine:</strong> Tracks price changes and sends
                    real-time alerts to users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AI Recommendations:</strong> Machine learning models analyze user
                    behavior to suggest relevant products.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges and Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                The major challenge was handling inconsistencies in data formats from
                various retailer APIs. To address this, a standardized data pipeline was
                implemented, ensuring all retrieved data adhered to a uniform schema.
                Additionally, optimizing the AI recommendation system for diverse user
                preferences required extensive testing and tuning.
            </p>
            <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Reduced product search time by 50% for users, as compared to manually
                    browsing multiple platforms.
                </li>
                <li>Achieved a 98% accuracy rate in price comparisons during testing.</li>
                <li>
                    Enhanced user retention by 40% due to personalized recommendations and
                    price alerts.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Integration with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant for
                    hands-free shopping.
                </li>
                <li>
