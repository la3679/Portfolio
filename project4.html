            <h2>Automated Test Oracle Generation using Neural Methods</h2>

            <!-- Overview -->
            <div class="project-overview">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project addresses a critical challenge in software development: the
                    creation of effective test oracles. Manual generation of test oracles is
                    labor-intensive and prone to errors. By leveraging neural networks, this
                    project automates the creation of two types of test oraclesâ€”exceptional
                    and assertion oracles. These oracles validate software behavior, ensuring
                    reliability and correctness while reducing manual effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is important to note that this project is not our original work. It was forked from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/toga" target="_blank">Microsoft's TOGA repository</a>, and the original paper can be accessed at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510003.3510141" target="_blank">Original TOGA Paper</a>. The purpose of our work was to replicate the original TOGA results and evaluate whether adding method implementations to the evaluation setup would alter the results. This project builds upon the findings from the original TOGA paper and introduces slight modifications to analyze their impact.
                </p>

                    The GitHub repository for this project, under a collaborator's name, is available <a href="https://github.com/pateljheel/swen777-rp-toga" target="_blank">here</a>. I actively participated in this work, and rather than forking the repository, we directly contributed to the implementation and evaluation.

            <!-- Background and Motivation -->
            <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Test oracles are essential for verifying software functionality. However,
                creating them manually is a bottleneck in agile development cycles. Existing
                tools often fail to achieve complete coverage or handle edge cases
                effectively. This project builds on the success of TOGA (Test Oracle
                Generation Application), exploring transformer-based neural networks for
                automating oracle creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key motivations include improving the accuracy and scalability of test
                oracle generation, reducing development costs, and enabling developers to
                focus on complex problem-solving rather than repetitive tasks.
            </p>

            <!-- Challenges and Resolutions -->
            <h3>Challenges and Resolutions</h3>
            <p>
                One major challenge was ensuring model robustness when handling edge cases.
                By augmenting the dataset with diverse examples, the model's performance
                improved significantly. Another challenge was optimizing the inference time
                for real-time applications, addressed by pruning transformer layers and
                employing lightweight neural models for deployment.
